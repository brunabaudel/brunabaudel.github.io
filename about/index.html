                      Naturally, I got into Computer Science.

                    <p>At the university, I was amazed by Algorithms, Linear Algebra,

                      It was the most profound and intense time of study in my life.
                      I was immersed in an extreme learning environment.
                      I had the opportunity to learn many different programming languages,
                      build many complex applications and algorithms,
                      work with a team of colleagues, and test my skills to the extreme.

                      At the university, I really wanted to build something meaningful with my skills.
                      Then, I co-founded a startup with my colleagues: Procura Tecnologia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We created eVita, an app to check medicine interactions.
                      It had more than 1 million interactions between medicines in the database.
                      I was responsible for the development of the iOS and Android apps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As nobody from the team had experience with building apps for iOS, 
                      I decided to take the responsibility and learn how to build iOS apps on my Samsung notebook!
                      It went very well. I learned Objective-C, Xcode, and the entire macOS environment.
                      I really loved this stack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I've been passionate about iOS development (even with Objective-C) since that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The startup went really well! We were one of the first in Brazil to have an iOS app on the App Store.
                      We received many offers from investors and clients to build other apps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Amazing times!

                      In the final year of my studies, I started working professionally with Android development.
                      I had the chance to work with very skilled people who taught me a lot about the Android
                      SDK using Java.

                      One of the latest projects at university was to build a mobile game.
                      We created Dustdog, an endless game where the dog would clean a beach with
                      its vacuum cleaner. A very creative game in my opinion. We used libGDX to develop the
                      game for both platforms (Android and iOS).

                      I was also responsible for maintaining the middleware that updated all the KPIs in the database

                    again. So, I accepted to go to Sri Lanka to work remotely as a freelancer together
                    with two Dutch guys. We worked a lot for 3 months straight and we made loads of money during that time.
