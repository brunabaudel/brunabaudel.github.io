      <h2>Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.</h2>
      <p>Let's use the two-pointer technique to solve this problem!</p>
      <p>
        Imagine there are two runners with different speed. If they are running
        on a straight path, the fast runner will first arrive at the
        destination. However, if they are running on a circular track, the fast
        runner will catch up with the slow runner if they keep running.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's exactly what we will come across using two pointers with
        different speed in a linked list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will stop at the end of the
          linked list.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet with the
          slow pointer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
        <p>
          So the only remaining problem is: 
          <div class="box">What should be the proper speed for
          the two pointers?</div>
        </p>
      <p>
        It is a safe choice to move the slow pointer one step at a time while
        moving the fast pointer two steps at a time. For each iteration, the
        fast pointer will move one extra step. If the length of the cycle is M,
        after M iterations, the fast pointer will definitely move one more cycle
        and catch up with the slow pointer.
      </p>
