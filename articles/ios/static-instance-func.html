                In Swift, when working with classes and structures, it's
                important to grasp the distinctions between static functions and
                instance methods. These two types of functions serve distinct
                purposes and offer different capabilities, which can
                significantly impact the design and behavior of your code.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title1"
                >Static Functions: Operating at the Class Level
              </span>
              <p>
                Static functions in Swift are associated with the class itself
                rather than any specific instance of the class. They are
                typically used to define functionality that does not rely on the
                state of any particular object but is related to the class as a
                whole. One of the key attributes of static functions is that
                they can be accessed directly on the class without needing to
                create an instance.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2">Example </span>
              <pre><code class="language-swift">class MathHelper {
    static func add(_ num1: Int, _ num2: Int) -> Int {
        return num1 + num2
    }
}
// Calling the static function without an instance
let result = MathHelper.add(5, 3)
print("Result of addition: \(result)")  // Output: Result of addition: 8
</code></pre>
              <p>
                In this example, the class
                <code class="language-swift">MathHelper</code> has a static
                function called <code class="language-swift">add</code> that
                takes two numbers and returns their sum. The
                <code class="language-swift">static</code> keyword means you can
                use this function directly with the class name, without creating
                an instance of the class. When
                <code class="language-swift">MathHelper.add(5, 3)</code> is
                called, it returns the sum of 5 and 3, which is 8. The final
                print statement outputs:
                <code class="language-swift">Result of addition: 8</code> .
              </p>

                >Key Characteristics of Static Functions
              </span>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Direct Access:</b> They can be accessed directly on the
                  class without the need for an instance of the class.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Limited Access:</b> They cannot access instance properties
                  or instance methods directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uniform Behavior:</b> They exhibit the same behavior across
                  all instances of the class.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>No Polymorphism:</b> They cannot be overridden in
                  subclasses, meaning their behavior remains consistent
                  throughout the class hierarchy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Class Context:</b> They operate in the context of the class
                  itself rather than any specific instance.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <span class="article-title1"
                >Instance Methods: Operating on Specific Instances
              </span>
              <p>
                Instance methods, on the other hand, are functions that operate
                on a specific instance of a class or structure. They have direct
                access to the properties and methods of the instance they are
                called on, enabling them to manipulate the state of the specific
                object. Instance methods are essential for defining behavior
                that depends on the unique characteristics of each object.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2">Example </span>
              <pre><code class="language-swift">class Counter {
    var count = 0
    func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
}
// Creating an instance and calling the instance method
let counter = Counter()
counter.increment()
print("Count after increment: \(counter.count)") // Output: Count after increment: 1
</code></pre>
              <p>
                In this example, we have a class called
                <code class="language-swift">ToyRobot</code> .Inside the class,
                there is a property
                <code class="language-swift">battery</code> which is initialized
                with a value of 100. Additionally, there is an instance method
                named <code class="language-swift">useBattery</code> that
                reduces the <code class="language-swift">battery</code> property
                by 10 each time it is called.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the code executes, an instance of the
                <code class="language-swift">ToyRobot</code> class is created
                using the line
                <code class="language-swift">let myRobot = ToyRobot()</code>
                .This instance is assigned to the variable
                <code class="language-swift">myRobot</code> .Then, the
                <code class="language-swift">useBattery</code> method is called
                on the <code class="language-swift">myRobot</code> instance
                using the line
                <code class="language-swift">myRobot.useBattery()</code> ,which
                reduces the <code class="language-swift">battery</code> property
                of the <code class="language-swift">myRobot</code> instance from
                100 to 90.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the print statement
                <code class="language-swift"
                  >print("Remaining battery: \(myRobot.battery)")</code
                >
                is used to display the value of the
                <code class="language-swift">battery</code> property of the
                <code class="language-swift">myRobot</code> instance, which is
                now 90 after the
                <code class="language-swift">useBattery</code> method call. So,
                the output would be:
                <code class="language-swift">Remaining battery: 90</code> .
              </p>

                >Key Characteristics of Instance Methods
              </span>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Instance Specific:</b> They are tied to and operate on a
                  specific instance of the class or structure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Full Access:</b> They can access and modify instance
                  properties and call other instance methods directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Diverse Behavior:</b> They can exhibit different behaviors
                  depending on the specific instance they are called on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Polymorphism:</b> They can be overridden in subclasses,
                  enabling polymorphic behavior within the class hierarchy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Object Context:</b> They operate in the context of a
                  specific instance of the class or structure.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Understanding the distinctions between static functions and
                instance methods is crucial for structuring your code
                effectively and ensuring that your functions behave as intended.
                By leveraging the appropriate type of function for the task at
                hand, you can create clear, maintainable, and efficient code
                that accurately represents the behavior of your classes and
                structures.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, static functions are ideal for defining
                functionality that is not tied to any specific instance, while
                instance methods are essential for manipulating the state of
                specific objects and enabling polymorphic behavior within class
                hierarchies.
