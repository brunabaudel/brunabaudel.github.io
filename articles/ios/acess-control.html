                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that
                plays a significant role in modern software development. It
                helps developers create organized and maintainable code by
                organizing data and behavior into objects. In Swift, OOP
                principles are an integral part of the language's design. One of
                the cornerstones of OOP in Swift is encapsulation, which allows
                us to hide the internal details of an object and provide
                controlled access to its properties and methods using access
                control modifiers.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title1">Understanding Encapsulation </span>
              <p>
                Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP. It is
                the practice of bundling data (properties) and methods
                (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known
                as an object. The primary goal of encapsulation is to restrict
                direct access to an object's internal state and ensure that it
                can only be modified through well-defined interfaces. This helps
                maintain data integrity and makes the code more robust and
                maintainable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Swift, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access
                control modifiers. These modifiers determine the level of
                visibility and accessibility for various components of a Swift
                program, including classes, properties, methods, and more.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title1"
                >Access Control Modifiers in Swift
              </span>
              <p>
                Swift provides several access control modifiers that allow
                developers to control the visibility and accessibility of
                various components within a codebase. These modifiers are:
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                ><code class="language-swift">open</code>
              </span>
              <p>
                The <code class="language-swift">open</code> modifier provides
                the highest level of visibility. Code elements marked as
                <code class="language-swift">open</code> can be accessed from
                anywhere, both within the module where they are defined and from
                external modules. It is often used when designing frameworks or
                libraries where you want to allow for subclassing and
                customization of classes.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                ><code class="language-swift">public</code>
              </span>
              <p>
                The <code class="language-swift">public</code> modifier also
                allows code elements to be accessed from anywhere, both within
                the module and from external modules. However, it is more
                restrictive than <code class="language-swift">open</code> in
                that it does not allow subclassing and overriding of methods by
                default. You would use
                <code class="language-swift">public</code> when you want to
                expose an interface but don't want it to be extended or
                subclassed.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                ><code class="language-swift">internal</code>
              </span>
              <p>
                The <code class="language-swift">internal</code> modifier is the
                default access level if none is specified. Code elements marked
                as <code class="language-swift">internal</code> can be accessed
                only within the module where they are defined. They are not
                accessible from outside the module.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                ><code class="language-swift">fileprivate</code>
              </span>
              <p>
                The <code class="language-swift">fileprivate</code> modifier
                restricts access to the containing file. This means that code
                elements marked as
                <code class="language-swift">fileprivate</code> can only be
                accessed within the same source file in which they are defined.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                ><code class="language-swift">private</code>
              </span>
              <p>
                The <code class="language-swift">private</code> modifier
                provides the most stringent level of access control. Code
                elements marked as
                <code class="language-swift">private</code> can only be accessed
                within the enclosing declaration (e.g., a class or struct). They
                are not accessible from other parts of the same file or any
                external modules.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                ><code class="language-swift">internal(set)</code> ,<code
                  class="language-swift"
                  >private(set)</code
                >
                ,and <code class="language-swift">public(set)</code>
              </span>
              <p>
                These modifiers are used for properties and indicate that a
                property can be read from anywhere but can only be modified
                within the same module (<code class="language-swift"
                  >internal(set)</code
                >
                ),the same file (<code class="language-swift"
                  >private(set)</code
                >
                ),or any module (<code class="language-swift">public(set)</code>
                ).They allow for controlled read-write access.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title1">Practical Use Cases </span>
              <p>
                To better understand the application of these access control
                modifiers, let's explore some practical use cases:
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                >1. <code class="language-swift">open</code> for Framework APIs
              </span>
              <p>
                When developing a reusable framework or library in Swift, you
                may want to expose certain classes, functions, or properties as
                <code class="language-swift">open</code> to allow other
                developers to use them while keeping the implementation details
                hidden. This promotes code reuse and ensures that users of your
                framework can't inadvertently modify its internal state.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                >2. <code class="language-swift">public</code> for
                Non-Extensible Interfaces
              </span>
              <p>
                For APIs that you want to expose but not allow for subclassing
                and method overriding, you can use the
                <code class="language-swift">public</code> modifier. This
                ensures that the interface remains stable and that clients of
                your code can't unintentionally modify its behavior.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                >3. <code class="language-swift">internal</code> for Module-Wide
                Access
              </span>
              <p>
                The <code class="language-swift">internal</code> modifier is
                useful when you want to allow access to certain code elements
                within the entire module but prevent external modules from using
                them. This is common for shared functionality within a module.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                >4. <code class="language-swift">fileprivate</code> for
                Fine-Grained Control
              </span>
              <p>
                The <code class="language-swift">fileprivate</code> modifier is
                handy for situations where you want to restrict access to code
                elements to a single source file. This is often used when
                multiple types within a file need to collaborate, but you want
                to hide the details from other files in the same module.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title2"
                >5. <code class="language-swift">private</code> for
                Implementation Details
              </span>
              <p>
                Within a class or struct, you can use the
                <code class="language-swift">private</code> modifier to hide
                implementation details and protect sensitive data. For example,
                you might use <code class="language-swift">private</code> to
                hide the internal state of a class and only provide controlled
                access through public methods.
              </p>
              <span class="article-title1">Conclusion </span>
              <p>
                Swift's access control modifiers provide a powerful mechanism
                for implementing encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
                By choosing the appropriate modifier for each component of your
                code, you can achieve the desired level of visibility and access
                control, promoting code organization, security, and
                maintainability. Whether you are building small applications or
                large frameworks, understanding and using these modifiers
                effectively is crucial for creating clean, robust, and modular
                Swift code.
